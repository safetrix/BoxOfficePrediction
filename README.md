This is a Box Office Movie Regression model that was made as a prooject for my Machine Learning class. Listed in the repo are the jupiter notebook and the public Kaggle dataset used to train/test the model.

The goal of this model was to retain MAE no less than 10 thousand (as this seems large enough to still be mildly accurate)
